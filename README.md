# Async-WPF-FileNameChanger

My friend had a very boring task in work. He had to copy 183433 files and changed their names. 
When he told me about this I decided that i would help him. It was a great opportunity to write a desktop application.
(Last time I wrote desktop app was several years ago) And to practise new from C# 5.0 async pattern - Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).
I've spent several evenings but I saved my friend very boring work and I pretty enjoyed this.
